# Stock-Sentiment-Analysis-Using-Machine-Learning-Techniques

This project aims to develop a sentiment analysis model to predict the movement of stock prices based on textual data from news articles, social media posts, and other sources of financial news and opinions. By analyzing the sentiment expressed in these texts, the model will seek to uncover insights into investor sentiment and market sentiment, which can be valuable indicators for making informed trading decisions.
